## Case Study Questions

1. **What is the total revenue generated by each customer?**  
2. **Which menu items are the most popular?**  
3. **How often do customers visit the diner?**  
4. **What is the average spend per customer?**  
5. **Which time periods see the highest sales?**

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following tables:

### 1. **Customers**  
   Contains details of diner customers:
   - `customer_id`  
   - `customer_name`

### 2. **Sales**  
   Tracks customer purchases:
   - `customer_id`  
   - `order_date`  
   - `menu_item`

### 3. **Menu**  
   Provides details about menu items:
   - `menu_item`  
   - `price`

You can find the SQL scripts to create and populate these tables in the repository.

## SQL Queries and Analysis

The repository contains a structured set of SQL queries to answer the case study questions. Key analyses include:
- Revenue calculation by customer.  
- Menu item popularity ranking.  
- Average order value and visit frequency per customer.  
- Time-series analysis of sales trends.

Each query is well-documented with comments for better understanding.

## Insights

- **Customer Preferences**: 
  - Customer A prefers Item X, while Customer B orders Item Y the most.  
  - These insights can help in personalized promotions.  

- **Popular Items**: 
  - Menu Item Z is the most frequently ordered, contributing to 40% of total revenue.  

- **Sales Trends**: 
  - Peak sales occur on weekends, suggesting the need for weekend-specific promotions.

## How to Run the Queries

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashwanthyg/Danny-s-Dinner-SQL.git
   ```
2. Import the provided SQL script to your SQL Server or compatible DBMS to create the database and tables:
   - `customers.sql`  
   - `sales.sql`  
   - `menu.sql`  
3. Run the analysis queries in `analysis.sql` to derive insights.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional datasets, such as customer demographics or feedback.  
- Visualize sales trends using Power BI or Tableau.  
- Use advanced SQL techniques like window functions for deeper analysis.  
- Predict sales trends using time-series models integrated with SQL queries.
